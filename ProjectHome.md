With the latest push for better performance of javascript in the browser, we can now start to consider calculating technical analysis functions and indicators of time series data on the client-side with Javascript.

This project's aim is to create TA functions (such as Exponential Moving Average, Rate of Change, RSI) that are accurate, fast, and easy to use - and are written completely in ECMAscript compatible Javascript.
